# EE 250L - Distributed Systems for the Internet of Things

## Course Description

This is a 4-unit undergraduate course aimed at electrical engineering, computer engineering and computer science students with at least a sophomore standing. Students will design, build and evaluate systems that incorporate hardware, operating systems, network and application layer protocols. Focus will be placed on distributed system applications for the Internet of Things. 

Through hands-on lab activities, assignments, projects, as well as through guest lectures spanning research and practice, the course provides a comprehensive introduction to many relevant topics including networks, programming networked and distributed applications, publish-subscribe middleware, wireless communications, sensors and actuators, printed circuit board design, signal processing and control systems, machine learning, security, and distributed computing. 

Weekly labs will provide the opportunity for students to apply concepts learned in class. Several homework assignments will also be given to help reinforce the concepts taught in the lecture.

## Learning Objectives

Below are the specific, measurable skills a student will demonstrate by the end of the course. These objectives will be both taught and assessed in the course and are aligned with the assignments, assessments and learning materials.

1. **Network Programming**: Develop applications that use the TCP/IP protocol suite and socket programming to make embedded devices communicate over the Internet.

2. **Publish-Subscribe Protocols**: Use publish-subscribe protocols such as MQTT to share messages in real time between distributed devices all over the Internet.

3. **Wireless Link Analysis**: Analyze how low power wireless links behave in terms of metrics such as signal quality, error rates, throughput, as a function of link distance, channel and power settings.

4. **Digital Communication**: Describe various physical signaling schemes and codes used in the transmission of digital data.

5. **Medium Access Control**: Understand how randomized and scheduled medium access (MAC) protocols allow multiple wireless devices to share a medium.

6. **PCB Design**: Create circuit schematics and use those schematics to create a printed circuit-board (PCB) design and layout and test a PCB's functionality.

7. **Power Management**: Apply sleep cycling and asynchronous MAC protocols to prolong the battery lifetime of an embedded device.

8. **Signal Processing**: Process raw data/signals from sensors to minimize noise and to estimate useful parameters such as a device's location.

9. **Security**: Compare and contrast cryptographic encryption schemes and security protocols to protect the confidentiality and integrity of data.

10. **Machine Learning**: Use machine learning to do data-driven binary classification.
